## Hello, it's ME!

I'm Katherine Davis, a software dev and bachelor of Computer Science from CSUF. My first forays into development were old HTML webpages back in the 2000s, and somehow I have largely returned to webdev... but now with cool modern tools like React. I also regularly work with Python and have dabbled in C++ and Java. Oh, and I also dev games in Godot.

Here's some cool projects (wip)
